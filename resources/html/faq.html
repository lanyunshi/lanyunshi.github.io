I may not have so much time to catch up with you frequently, but I do except that you can give me feedback initially. <strong>serious</strong> indicates you can have your private space, I keep respect to your personal instersts but I do think we should have the same goal and you should take the work that I assign to you seriously. <strong>diligent</strong> indicates that research is not always smooth, but you should be open to the research questions and do not give up easily.</p>
